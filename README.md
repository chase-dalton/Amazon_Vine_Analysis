## Summary
With there being 51.1% of paid users leaving 5-star reviews and only 38.7% of unpaid users leaving 5-star reviews, it does seem that there is a positivity bias amongst the paid users, at least amongst the video game reviews. Before definitively claiming that there is a positivity bias amongst Amazon Vine users, it would be wise to do analyses across multiple datasets, not just video games. With only 94 paid reviews compared to the 40,471 unpaid reviews, the paid review data is quite small in this dataset and this trend may not apply to other datasets where there are more paid users to analyze.
